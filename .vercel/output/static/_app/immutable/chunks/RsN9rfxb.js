This is distinct from client-side rendering, where the content is rendered in the browser using JavaScript.</p></section> <section><h2 id="frontend-devs"><a href="#frontend-devs">Frontend Devs</a></h2><p>SSR is particularly relevant for your work as a front-end engineer, especially when dealing with frameworks and libraries that can operate on both server and client sides. Here’s a breakdown of how it works and its benefits:</p></section> <section><h2 id="how-server-side-rendering-works"><a href="#how-server-side-rendering-works">How Server-Side Rendering Works</a></h2><ul><li>Request Made: When a user requests a webpage, the request is sent to the server.</li> <li>Server Processing: The server processes the request, runs the necessary back-end logic, and renders the HTML content of the page.</li> <li>HTML Response: The server sends the fully rendered HTML to the client.</li> <li>Browser Display: The client’s browser receives the HTML and displays the page. JavaScript may then be used to add interactivity to the page.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="benefits-of-server-side-rendering"><a href="#benefits-of-server-side-rendering">Benefits of Server-Side Rendering</a></h2><ul><li>Faster Initial Load: Users see the content faster because the browser doesn’t need to download, parse, and execute JavaScript before rendering the page content.</li> <li>SEO Friendly: Since the content is rendered before it reaches the browser, search engine crawlers can index it more effectively, improving SEO.</li> <li>Consistent Performance: SSR can offer more consistent performance across different devices, especially where client-side resources are limited.</li> <li>No JavaScript Requirement: Users with JavaScript disabled can still view the content.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="considerations"><a href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h2><ul><li>Server Load: SSR can put more load on the server, as it needs to render pages for each request.</li> <li>Development Complexity: Building an SSR application can be more complex, particularly when integrating with APIs and handling dynamic content.</li> <li>User Interactivity: For pages that require heavy user interactions, client-side rendering might still be needed to make the page dynamic after the initial load.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="technologies-supporting-ssr"><a href="#technologies-supporting-ssr">Technologies Supporting SSR</a></h2><ul><li>Node.js: Often used for SSR with JavaScript, allowing you to use the same language on both server and client sides.</li> <li>Frameworks and Libraries: Frameworks like Next.js (for React), Nuxt.js (for Vue), and Angular Universal offer built-in SSR capabilities, simplifying the process of setting up SSR for your applications.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>Integrating SSR into your web development projects can significantly improve the performance and SEO of the websites you build, especially for content-heavy sites.</p></section> <section><h2 id="learn-more"><a href="#learn-more">Learn more</a></h2><p>Server Side Rendering in JavaScript – SSR vs CSR Explained on freecodecamp.org: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/server-side-rendering-javascript/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/server-side-rendering-javascript/</a></p></section>',1);function g(e){var r=o();t(14),n(e,r)}export{g as default,s as metadata};

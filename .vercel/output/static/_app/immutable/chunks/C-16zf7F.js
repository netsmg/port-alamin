The focus is on making a good user experience, where interacting with a website is pleasing and easy. A good design, clear content, fast load times and nice interactions with appropriate animations are all part of a good user experience. In common usage, “the UX” of a site or app often refers to the design and interaction combined.</p><ul><li>Defining a problem</li> <li>Understanding users</li> <li>Creating personas</li> <li>Generating tasks & user flows</li> <li>Creating sketches -> wireframes -> prototypes</li> <li>Usability testing</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="what-does-a-ui-designer-do"><a href="#what-does-a-ui-designer-do">What does a UI Designer do?</a></h2><p>UI Designers make products joyful to interact with.

Visual priority = user priority.</p><p>Information hierarchy is mainly created by <strong>CONTRAST</strong>. Always consider contrast before color.</p><p>When in doubt, <strong>ALIGN EVERYTHING</strong>. Alignment creates order, flow and stability.</p><p>Purposefully design all <strong>NEGATIVE SPACE</strong>. Give it more attention than UI elements.</p><p>Primary elements should come <strong>FORWARD</strong>. Secondary elements should <strong>RECEDE</strong>. You should work to visually differentiate the two.</p><p>Maximize <strong>SIGNAL</strong>. Minimize <strong>NOISE</strong>.

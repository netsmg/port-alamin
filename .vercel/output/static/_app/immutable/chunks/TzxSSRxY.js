It’s a text-based format, consisting of name-value pairs and ordered lists of values, which is used extensively in web development and various other programming contexts. Here’s a breakdown of its key characteristics:</p><p>Lightweight Data Format: JSON is text-based, making it lightweight and suitable for data interchange.
Human and Machine Readable: Its structure is simple and clear, making it readable by humans and easily parsed by machines.
Language Independent: Despite its name, JSON is independent of JavaScript and can be used with many programming languages.
JSON’s simplicity, efficiency, and wide support across programming languages have made it a fundamental tool in modern software development, particularly for web APIs, configuration management, and data interchange in distributed systems.</p></section> <section><h2 id="learn-more"><a href="#learn-more">Learn more</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">https://www.json.org/json-en.html</a></li> <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON</a></li></ul></section>`,1);function g(e){var a=i();r(2),n(e,a)}export{g as default,o as metadata};

If you give them too many obstacles to get a thing, they might give up.</p><p>Avoid too lengthy forms to convert better. Same thing happens with eCommerce industry.</p><p>Cart Abandonment Rate is 69% the second major reason for this is Account creation.</p></section> <section><h2 id="decision-paralysis"><a href="#decision-paralysis">Decision Paralysis</a></h2><p>Don’t overwhelm users with too many choices. When presented with more choices or too much infomrmation to decide, human mind gives up or unable to make a decision.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Give users few options to choose from</li> <li>Have you even seen a website with more than 4 Pricing packages?</li></ul><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJQT1ei.png" alt="pricing ui"></section> <section><h2 id="people-dont-read-they-scan"><a href="#people-dont-read-they-scan">People don’t read, they scan</a></h2><p>People don’t read on websites, they scan. Humans are only interested in information they need. There are two scanning patterns:</p><ul><li>Z-pattern</li> <li>F-pattern</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="user-makes-mistakes"><a href="#user-makes-mistakes">User makes mistakes</a></h2><p>Even if your app scores 100% on usability scale, users still make mistakes. There are two ways you can limit this</p><ul><li>Don’t let it happen in the first place</li> <li>Guide the user to fix the mistake easily (when users delete an email Gmail, there is an Undo button)</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="distraction"><a href="#distraction">Distraction</a></h2><p>From a UX perspective, we can design software, websites and all digital interfaces to minimize distraction and focus the user’s attention onto one task at a time and don’t put burden on our user’s brain.</p><p>Example: Google search term prediction when you type something.</p></section> <section><h2 id="how-humans-make-decisions"><a href="#how-humans-make-decisions">How humans make decisions?</a></h2><p>Most of the decisions made by users are by Unconscious Mind (OLD brain). Most mental processing occurs unconsciously.</p><p>Example: It takes 0.05 seconds for users to form an opinion about a site - all a customer needs to decide whether they’ll leave or stay.</p></section> <section><h2 id="trust-and-first-impressions"><a href="#trust-and-first-impressions">Trust and First Impressions</a></h2><p>According to web credibility research from Stanford, 75% of users admit to making judgements about a company’s credibility based on their website’s design</p><p>People are more likely to purchase products if they perceive a high degree trust. This is influenced by the level of overall user experience and perceived quality of product.</p></section> <section><h2 id="rational-and-calculated-decisions"><a href="#rational-and-calculated-decisions">Rational and calculated decisions</a></h2><p>Rational or new brain kicks in when you need to compare things or when calculations are neccesary. Also when OLD brain can’t make a decision, it will get help from concious brain.</p><p>Like when users compare two products while shopping online side by side and see the difference in features. That’s your NEW brain</p></section> <section><h2 id="humans-hate-change"><a href="#humans-hate-change">Humans hate change</a></h2><p>Humans resist change. When a website gets a totally different redesign, most users don’t like it at all. They will start complaining about it.</p><p>Solution: Progressive change and consistency in design. If Facebook moves its button on each post to the top. What do you think will happen?</p><p><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/3-painful-site-redesign-disasters/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">site redesign disaster</a></p></section> <section><h2 id="do-we-really-need-a-new-solution"><a href="#do-we-really-need-a-new-solution">Do we really need a new solution</a></h2><p>Before making any change see if users really need a new solution or you just need to adjust the old one for better UX</p><p>Ex: Yahoo and Digg failed when they introduced new redesigned websites. Digg’s traffic dropped by more than 25% in USA & UK.</p></section> <section><h2 id="actions-are-goal-oriented"><a href="#actions-are-goal-oriented">Actions are goal-oriented</a></h2><p>Our actions are based on our goals. Whatever we do, there is an aim behind it</p><p>EX: I’m using Google to search for a Painkiller medicine. So goals are what makes different uses of the same product possible</p><p>That is why Goals an Motivations recorded in User Interviews</p></section> <section><h2 id="change-blindness"><a href="#change-blindness">Change Blindness</a></h2><p>You are blind to almost anything other than your goal. That is why we are blind to changes which we are not interested in.</p><p>EX: I’m searching for a video so I will skip all the articles and webpages on that topic. My eyes will be constantly looking for videos. (SCANNING is normal human behaviour)</p></section> <section><h2 id="final-words"><a href="#final-words">Final words</a></h2><p>Don’t try to follow trends, try to be loyal to your customers first.</p></section>',1);function u(e){var i=s();n(24),t(e,i)}export{u as default,o as metadata};

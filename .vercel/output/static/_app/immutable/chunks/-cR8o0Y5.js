I dive deep into the client’s world.</p><p>Who are they? Who is their audience? What problem do they solve?</p><p>This phase helps me gather all the important details and sets a solid foundation of trust when you get on a call with your client.</p></section> <section><h2 id="defining-the-brand-identity-strategy"><a href="#defining-the-brand-identity-strategy">Defining the Brand Identity Strategy</a></h2><p>With research in hand, I craft a clear brand strategy. This includes defining the value proposition and key messaging.</p><p>I ask: What makes this brand unique? How can we communicate that clearly?</p><p>This step ensures that every design decision supports the overall identity strategy.</p><p>It will help preventing the design and copywriting to be bland branding.</p><p>I also do a competitive analysis to see what other brands are doing in the space so we can do something different.</p></section> <section><h2 id="design-concept-development"><a href="#design-concept-development">Design Concept Development</a></h2><p>Now, I brainstorm ideas by curating custom mood boards to explore 3 different directions based on the goals and identity strategy.</p><p>I gather a bunch of images:</p><ul><li>Logos</li> <li>Typography</li> <li>Website hero layouts</li> <li>Illustrations</li> <li>Icons</li> <li>Colours</li> <li>Packaging</li></ul><p>I let the ideas flow and then narrow down to the concepts that best align with the brand’s vision.</p></section> <section><h2 id="design-execution"><a href="#design-execution">Design Execution</a></h2><p>Here’s where the fun begins.</p><p>I bring the chosen concept to life by designing logos, selecting colors, typography, and all the visual elements.</p><p>I do this all in Adobe Illustrator, it’s a work horse.</p><p>Throwing things on my artboard and exploring many ideas even if it’s weird or colourful.</p><p>This part of the process can be messy, don’t be fooled by the clean bentos you see out there. That’s design in it’s final form.</p></section> <section><h2 id="revisions--refinement"><a href="#revisions--refinement">Revisions & Refinement</a></h2><p>I share the designs with the client with a Loom recording breaking down my thinking, design decisions and the overall story of the brand.</p><p>This step is all about refinement and gauging where the clients emotions are at.</p><p>After getting raw feedback via email or a call I implement any changes and tweaks if needed.</p></section> <section><h2 id="presentation--storytelling"><a href="#presentation--storytelling">Presentation & Storytelling</a></h2><p>Gone are the days of the “magic reveal.”</p><p>Today, I present the work with a clear narrative and explain the thinking behind every design decision.</p><p>This storytelling builds trust and demonstrates the value of a structured logical process.</p><p>Humans are emotional as well so them feeling the energy and excitement on your designs will make them excited too.</p></section> <section><h2 id="final-delivery--implementation"><a href="#final-delivery--implementation">Final Delivery & Implementation</a></h2><p>The last step is all about handing over the assets. If this part is smooth they will remember it because it’s the last thing on their mind.</p><p>I provide all the files, guidelines, and any support needed for implementation in a Dropbox folder with the project name. A clear handover makes sure that the brand is consistently represented across all channels.</p><p>It’s what sets apart a great design from a good one. And more importantly, it’s what gives my clients the confidence that they’re working with someone who knows exactly what they’re doing.</p></section> <section><h2 id="tldr"><a href="#tldr">TLDR</a></h2><ul><li><ol><li>Research & Discovery: Understand the client, audience, and problem they solve.

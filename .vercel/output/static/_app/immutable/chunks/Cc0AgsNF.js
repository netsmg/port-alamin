To switch to 1x artboards, simply change the width to 375 pixels and the height to 667 pixels. Then, you can save this preset as ‘iPhone 6’ for future reference (instead of using Photoshop’s default iPhone 6 template which is 2x). Even though the units are pixels, keep in mind that because you are designing in 1x, it is also 375x667 pts.</p></section></section>',1);function g(e){var t=n();a(2),i(e,t)}export{g as default,s as metadata};

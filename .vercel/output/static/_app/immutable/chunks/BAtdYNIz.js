It involves using HTML tags that introduce meaning to the web content. This practice not only helps in creating web pages that are informational and easy to navigate but also plays a significant role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and accessibility.</p></section> <section><h2 id="key-points-about-semantic-html"><a href="#key-points-about-semantic-html">Key points about semantic HTML</a></h2><section><h3 id="descriptive-tags"><a href="#descriptive-tags">Descriptive Tags</a></h3><p>Instead of using generic tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> for every element, semantic HTML encourages the use of specific tags that describe their purpose and content. For example, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for navigation links, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for introductory content, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> for footer information, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> for a self-contained composition, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for a thematic grouping of content, and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> for tangential content that could be considered separate from the main content.</p></section><section><h3 id="accessibility"><a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a></h3><p>Semantic tags make it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the content of a webpage. This is crucial for users with disabilities. For instance, a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element clearly indicates to a screen reader that it contains navigation links.</p></section><section><h3 id="seo-benefits"><a href="#seo-benefits">SEO Benefits</a></h3><p>Search engines give higher priority to web content that is semantically structured because it’s easier for them to understand the context and relevance of the content.

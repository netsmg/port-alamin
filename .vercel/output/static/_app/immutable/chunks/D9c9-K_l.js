Smart notes are active and involve restructuring other peopleâ€™s thoughts into our own structure.
The Q/E/C method (Question, Evidence, Conclusion) is a great structure to use when taking smart notes.
Smart notes should be atomic, meaning the size and ideas on them matter.
Organizing notes in one giant document limits our ability to think, and creating atomic notes can help us become more powerful thinkers.</p></section> <section><h2 id="atomic-ideas"><a href="#atomic-ideas">Atomic ideas</a></h2><p>Using atomic ideas instead of a giant document allows for 3D thinking and easier recollection of ideas.
Making each question, evidence, and conclusion its own atomic note is crucial for rearranging and connecting ideas.
Connecting new ideas to existing ones helps combat the illusion of competence.
The compass of the Zettelkasten thinking can be used to connect new ideas to existing ones in four different directions.
Focusing on systems rather than goals is important for forming good habits and breaking bad ones.</p></section> <section><h2 id="thinking-in-multiple-directions"><a href="#thinking-in-multiple-directions">Thinking in multiple directions</a></h2><p>Thinking in multiple directions can help generate solutions for climate change and diversity issues.
Connecting ideas is important for problem-solving.

Created an automatic gold-beating machine for textile production in Florence.</li> <li>Automation’s Goal: Always to boost productivity – starting with manufacturing, and now essential in digital workflows, like CI/CD pipelines for development and testing.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="rise-of-automation-in-qa"><a href="#rise-of-automation-in-qa">Rise of Automation in QA</a></h2><p>Early 2010s: Automation in QA exploded, with CI/CD promising the ability to automate almost anything.
Pessimism & Role Changes: Testers worried about job security as automation became essential in Agile’s fast-paced environment.
Popular Tools: Selenium and Cypress ruled – coding skills were needed for automation.</p></section> <section><h2 id="ai-steps-in"><a href="#ai-steps-in">AI Steps In</a></h2><p>AI-Driven Tools: Today, AI-powered automation can record tests, no coding needed – cutting down time and effort.
Limits of Automation:
Great for functional tests but struggles with subjective areas like usability and accessibility.
Human Testing: Still essential for complex, intuitive tasks that machines miss.</p></section> <section><h2 id="balance-in-testing-human--automation"><a href="#balance-in-testing-human--automation">Balance in Testing: Human + Automation</a></h2><ul><li>Humans vs. Tech: Humans detect nuances and adapt; machines excel at repetition.</li> <li>Avoid Automating Everything: Choose what needs automating. Don’t add automation just for stats.</li> <li>Test Pyramid: Automate at the lowest level (unit tests), reduce end-to-end tests.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="wise-automation"><a href="#wise-automation">Wise Automation</a></h2><ul><li>Strategic Focus: Focus on high-risk areas, like order flows for e-commerce.</li> <li>Team Strategy: Plan automation in team sessions to maximize value.</li></ul></section> <section><h2 id="the-future-of-automation-in-qa"><a href="#the-future-of-automation-in-qa">The Future of Automation in QA</a></h2><p>Autonomous Testing: Bots could handle all testing, but they lack empathy and creativity – real QA needs humans.
Balanced Approach: Automate repetitive tasks; keep humans for exploratory, creative testing.</p></section> <section><h2 id="in-summary"><a href="#in-summary">In Summary</a></h2><p>Automation boosts efficiency but doesn’t replace the human touch. Automate smartly, and remember that balanced testing means better quality.</p></section>`,1);function h(t){var e=s();o(12),a(t,e)}export{h as default,n as metadata};
